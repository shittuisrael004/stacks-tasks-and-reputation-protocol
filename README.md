# stacks-tasks-and-reputation-protocol

A junior-friendly, on-chain task marketplace and reputation system built on Stacks mainnet using Clarity.

This project is intentionally modular and simple, designed to demonstrate real smart contract engineering skills without unnecessary complexity.

Each contract is independently deployable and contributes to a cohesive protocol.

## 🎯 Why This Project Exists

This protocol demonstrates:
- Practical use of STX transfers on mainnet
- Modular contract architecture
- State management with maps and data-vars
- Access control & ownership patterns
- Task lifecycle logic
- Reputation & incentive mechanisms
