# Stacks Tasks & Reputation Protocol

A single-contract, on-chain task marketplace and reputation system built on the **Stacks blockchain** using **Clarity**.

This project demonstrates real-world smart contract engineering skills: STX escrow, access control, lifecycle management, event-driven design, and safe recovery patterns, all implemented with junior-friendly clarity and production-aware tradeoffs.

The protocol has been **tested on Stacks Testnet and deployed on Stacks Mainnet**, with all core flows manually verified.
