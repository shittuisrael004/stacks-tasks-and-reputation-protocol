# Stacks Tasks & Reputation Protocol

A junior-friendly, on-chain task marketplace and reputation system built on Stacks mainnet using Clarity.

This project is intentionally modular and simple, designed to demonstrate real smart contract engineering skills without unnecessary complexity.

Each contract is independently deployable and contributes to a cohesive protocol.


## 🎯 Why This Project Exists

This protocol demonstrates:

- Practical use of STX transfers on mainnet
- Modular contract architecture
- State management with maps and data-vars
- Access control & ownership patterns
- Task lifecycle logic
- Reputation & incentive mechanisms


## 🧱 Architecture Overview

The protocol is split into multiple focused contracts:

1. Core protocol configuration
2. User & role management
3. Task creation, funding, assignment, and review
4. STX-based payouts
5. Reputation & achievements
6. Utility, logging, and governance helpers

Each contract does one thing well.


## 📜 Smart Contracts

The contracts with clear comments explaining purpose and logic can be seen in the contracts folder.


## ✅ Final Notes

- All contracts are deployable on Stacks mainnet
- STX transfers are handled safely via stx-transfer?
- Modular design encourages future upgrades
- Code favors clarity and readability over cleverness
